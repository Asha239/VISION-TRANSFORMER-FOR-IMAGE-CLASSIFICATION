    "Image classification refers to the task of assigning a label or a category to an input image based on its visual content. It involves training a model to recognize and differentiate between different objects, scenes, or patterns within images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision Transformers (ViTs) are an exciting development in the field of computer vision, leveraging the Transformer architecture initially designed for natural language processing. The introduction of Transformers revolutionized NLP by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and achieving exceptional performance on tasks like machine translation and language understanding.\n",
    "Now, this transformative architecture has been successfully applied to image classification tasks, yielding promising outcomes that often surpass the capabilities of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This recent advancement in image classification using ViTs has created a significant buzz in the field. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the concept and knowledge surrounding ViTs in order to fully exploit their potential and stay up to date with the latest developments in this rapidly evolving domain.\n",
    "The Vision Transformer is a model  treats images as sequences of smaller patches, like a sentence we assume that part of the images are related. We show in the image by <a href=https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/main/images/vit.gif>Phil Wang</a> , an image is divided into 9 patches. Each patch is considered a \"word\" or \"token\" and is transformed into a feature space. By adding positional encodings and a classification token, we can use a Transformer model to train on this sequence for image classification. Below is a GIF that visualizes the architecture.\n",

They have completely transformed how image recognition is approached by substituting the conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with **self-attention mechanisms**. This upgrade enables Vision Transformers to process visual data in a highly efficient and parallelized manner. Notably, Vision Transformers have outperformed traditional CNN-based methods, setting new standards in object detection, image classification, and segmentation tasks. Their exceptional performance on various benchmarks highlights their effectiveness and potential in the field of computer vision.\n"

    "\n",
    "In Vision Transformers, the entire image is divided into smaller sections called patches. These patches are similar to pieces of a puzzle that come together to form the complete picture. What's fascinating is that each patch has the ability to \"look at\" and consider all the other patches in the image. It pays attention to their features and tries to comprehend how they are connected to each other. This global attention mechanism allows the model to analyze the image as a whole and capture the relationships between distant regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision Transformers begin by focusing on local patches and gradually expand their understanding to encompass the broader context. This unique capability of capturing both local and global relationships is what sets them apart. They can effectively learn from various parts of the image and gain insight into how these parts fit together.\n"

The MNIST dataset acts as a standard for evaluating and comparing algorithms and models for tasks such as image classification. Its simplicity and accessibility have made it a go-to option for beginners to delve into and grasp various machine learning techniques. For more information on the MNIST dataset, you can visit [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsIBMSkillsNetworkGPXX0CLHEN3536-2023-01-01#torchvision.datasets.MNIST). We would like to classify the digit given the image of the digit.\n"

    "***Normalization*** refers to the process of adjusting the intensity values of image pixels to a specific range. One common approach is to scale the pixel values to fall within the range of [0, 1]. Another approach is standardization, which brings the pixel values to a range of [-1, 1].\n",

    "**Why do we use Normalization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Normalization*** serves multiple purposes in data preprocessing for machine learning tasks. It helps prevent certain features from dominating the training process and can aid in reducing computational costs. By bringing the pixel values to a similar scale, normalization facilitates the convergence of models and contributes to more accurate results.\n"

    "Here's a breakdown of what each parameter represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>embed_dim</code>: This parameter determines the dimensionality of the embedded feature representation of each patch in the image. In this case, it is set to 256.\n",
    "- <code>hidden_dim</code>: It represents the dimensionality of the hidden layer in the model. The hidden layer contains intermediate representations and computations. Here, it is set to 512.\n",
    "- <code>num_heads</code>: This parameter specifies the number of attention heads in the self-attention mechanism. Each head attends to different parts of the input, allowing the model to capture different types of relationships. In this case, there are 8 attention heads.\n",
    "- <code>num_layers</code>: It indicates the number of transformer layers in the VisionTransformer model. Each layer processes the input sequentially, refining the representations. Here, there are 6 transformer layers.\n",
    "- <code>patch_size</code>: It represents the size of each patch extracted from the input image. In this case, patches are square and have a size of 4x4 pixels.\n",
    "- <code>num_channels</code>: This parameter denotes the number of channels in the input image. For grayscale images, like in this case, the number of channels is 1.\n",
    "- <code>num_patches</code>: It indicates the total number of patches that make up the image. This value is calculated based on the image size and patch size. Here, there are 64 patches.\n",
    "- <code>num_classes</code>: This parameter specifies the number of classes in the classification task. In this case, the model is designed for a classification problem with 10 classes.\n",
    "- <code>dropout</code>: It represents the dropout rate, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training. Here, the dropout rate is set to 0.2, meaning 20% of the input units will be zeroed out during training.\n"
